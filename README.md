# Alterview - AI-Powered Student Interviews

Alterview is an application designed to revolutionize student interviews using AI. This project provides a structured navigation system for both students and teachers.

## Project Structure

The application follows a clear routing structure:

### Home Page (/)
- Landing page with options for Student and Teacher login

### Student Flow
1. **Student Login** (`/student-login`)
   - Simple login form for students
2. **Student Dashboard** (`/students/:student_id`)
   - Displays assessments available to the student
3. **Student Interview** (`/assessment/:student_id/:assessment_id`)
   - The actual interview page where students interact with the AI

### Teacher Flow
1. **Teacher Login** (`/teacher-login`)
   - Simple login form for teachers
2. **Teacher Dashboard** (`/teacher/:teacher_id`)
   - Displays assessments created by the teacher
3. **Create Assessment** (`/teacher/:teacher_id/create-assessment`)
   - Page for creating new assessments
4. **Assessment Review** (`/teacher/:teacher_id/assessment/:assessment_id`)
   - Detailed view of a specific assessment with student results

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Technologies Used

- Next.js 14 with App Router
- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Vapi AI for voice interactions

## Development Notes

- The current implementation includes placeholder pages with minimal UI
- Data flow and business logic will be implemented in future iterations
- The interview functionality is located at `/assessment/:student_id/:assessment_id`
